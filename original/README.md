# Example of using Google Gemini API

This is an example of using the Google Gemini API to translate a text from English to Selected output language.

- If you cant understand the code, you can use the executable release from the [releases page](https://github.com/the-asind/gemini-markdown-translate/releases).
- If you want to use the code, you can clone the repository and install the package using pip.
- If you cant understand translated language, you probably forgot to change the output language in `promt.md`.
